### **Virus**

**Replication**: Attaches its code to other programs or documents, replicating when the host is activated.

**Trigger:** Activated when the infected host program is executed or a specific condition is met.

**Insertion:** Inserts malicious code into executable files or system areas, modifying program behavior.

**Harm/Objectives:** Can vary from benign pranks to serious damage, such as data corruption, system performance degradation, or unauthorized access facilitation.

**Detection:** Identified via antivirus software using signature, heuristic, or behavior-based methods.

### Worm

**Replication:** Independently replicates and spreads across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities without human interaction.

**Trigger:** Often self-activating upon execution or network presence, requiring no host program.
Insertion: Propagates by exploiting network vulnerabilities or using mass-mailing capabilities.

**Harm/Objectives:** Aims to spread widely, potentially causing network congestion and delivering payloads for additional damage.

**Detection:** Noted for generating significant network traffic, detected through network monitoring and anomaly detection tools.

### Trojan Horse

**Replication:** Does not replicate itself; relies on user actions for distribution.
Trigger: Activated by users who are deceived into executing or installing it, thinking it is legitimate.

**Insertion:** Poses as benign software but performs malicious actions once activated.

**Harm/Objectives:** Creates backdoors, steals data, or damages systems, often enabling further malicious activities.

**Detection:** Detected by observing suspicious behavior or using antivirus solutions that identify known Trojans.

### Spyware
**Replication:** Typically does not self-replicate; spread through bundled software or deceptive practices.
**Trigger:** Often runs quietly in the background without user knowledge, activated post-installation.

**Insertion:** Installs itself stealthily to monitor user actions and harvest data.

**Harm/Objectives:** Collects personal information, internet habits, and sensitive data, usually for advertising or malicious intent.

**Detection:** Identified through antispyware tools, anomaly detection, or performance degradation symptoms.

### Adware
**Replication:** Does not self-replicate; distributed via bundled installations or deceptive downloads.

**Trigger:** Activates with the host application or at system startup, displaying ads.

**Insertion:** Integrated into free software or downloads, showing ads to the user during operation.

**Harm/Objectives:** Generates revenue through ad displays, sometimes tracking user behavior; can degrade user experience.

**Detection:** Detected by antispyware or antivirus programs, often noticed due to intrusive ad behavior.

### Ransomware
**Replication:** Does not inherently replicate; spreads through phishing, exploits, or other malware.

**Trigger:** Executed by the user or automatically upon infection, encrypting user files or systems.

**Insertion:** Delivered via malicious downloads, email attachments, or vulnerabilities, then locks or encrypts files.

**Harm/Objectives:** Demands payment for decryption, causing data loss or financial harm.

**Detection:** Identified through unusual file activity, access denials, or ransom messages, often with specialized tools.
### Rootkit
**Replication:** Does not replicate; installed through vulnerabilities or alongside other malware.

**Trigger:** Operates covertly upon system startup or installation, hiding its presence.
Insertion: Embeds deeply into the OS, often below the standard antivirus detection layer.

**Harm/Objectives:** Conceals other malicious activities, maintains persistent access, and evades detection.

**Detection:** Challenging to detect; requires specialized tools, integrity checks, or behavior analysis.

### Logic Bomb
**Replication:** Does not replicate; planted within legitimate programs or systems.

**Trigger:** Activated by specific conditions or events, often predefined by the attacker.

**Insertion:** Embedded in software or scripts, waiting for triggering conditions.

**Harm/Objectives:** Executes malicious actions when triggered, which can range from data deletion to system disruption.

**Detection:** Hard to identify before activation; requires code auditing or monitoring for unusual activity.

### Backdoor
**Replication:** Typically does not replicate; installed directly or through other malware.

**Trigger:** Allows remote access anytime, often hidden to avoid detection.

**Insertion:** Incorporated into software, firmware, or during an attack, creating unauthorized access points.

**Harm/Objectives:** Facilitates remote control, data theft, or further system compromise.

**Detection:** Detected by monitoring unexpected network traffic, auditing systems, or identifying unusual access patterns.

### Routing and Switching Devices:

**Routers:** Direct traffic between networks.

**Switches:** Connect devices within the same network segment.
### Security Devices:

**Firewalls:** Establish barriers between different network zones based on security policies.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Detect and potentially prevent unauthorized access or violations.

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Protect sensitive data from leaving the network unauthorizedly.

**NAC (Network Access Control):** Enforce security policy compliance on devices trying to access network resources, effectively controlling access based on device and user adherence to policy.

**Proxy Server:** Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers, providing both security functions like filtering and caching and masking IP addresses for privacy.
### Connectivity Enhancement Devices:

**VPN (Virtual Private Network) Appliances:** Secure network connection over the internet.

**Wireless Access Points (WAP):** Connect wireless devices to a wired network.

**Load Balancer:** Distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of web applications, websites, and databases.
### Network Monitoring and Management Devices:

**Network Probes and Analyzers:** Tools for monitoring network traffic.
**Network Management Systems (NMS):** Centralized monitoring and management of the network.
### Network Services Devices:

**DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses, essential for internet browsing.

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Assigns IP addresses to devices on a network automatically, enabling devices to join and communicate on the network without manual configuration.

By integrating these devices into the respective categories based on their primary functions, it becomes easier to understand their roles within a network:

**Routing and Switching Devices:** Direct and deliver data.

**Security Devices:** Safeguard information and access.

**Connectivity Enhancement Devices:** Improve and expand connection options.

**Network Monitoring and Management Devices:** Oversee and optimize network performance.

**Network Services Devices:** Facilitate essential network functionalities and services.
